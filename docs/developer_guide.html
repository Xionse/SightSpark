    <h1>SightSpark Developer Guide</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the SightSpark developer guide. This document is intended to provide information and resources for developers who are interested in contributing to the SightSpark project.</p>

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>To get started with developing for SightSpark, you will need to have the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A development environment set up for Python</li>
        <li>The latest version of SightSpark codebase</li>
        <li>A basic understanding of Git and Github</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can download the latest version of the SightSpark codebase from the official Github repository at [https://github.com/sightspark/sightspark] </p>
    <p>We recommend using git to clone the repository and then create a new branch to make your changes on.</p>

    <h2>Development Workflow</h2>
    <p>The SightSpark development workflow is based on the Gitflow workflow. Before you start working on a new feature or bug fix, you should create a new branch from the develop branch and give it a descriptive name. This will make it easier to keep track of your changes and merge them back into the main codebase later.</p>
    <p>We use pull requests to review and merge changes. This allows other team members to review your code and provide feedback before it is merged into the main codebase.</p>
    <p>Please make sure that you test your code thoroughly before submitting a pull request. This includes both manual testing and running automated tests. The SightSpark project uses Pytest for running automated tests.</p>

    <h2>Coding Standards</h2>
    <p>The SightSpark project follows the PEP 8 coding style guide for Python. This includes guidelines for naming conventions, indentation, and commenting. Please make sure that your code adheres to these standards before submitting a pull request.</p>

    <h2>Contribution Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Before making a contribution, please take a look at our contribution guidelines which can be found on our website at [https://www.sightspark.com/contribute]. This will provide you with more information about our development process and the types of contributions that we are looking for.</p>
    <p>We are always looking for contributions from the community, whether you are a developer, tester, or documentation writer. Your contributions are greatly appreciated and help us to make SightSpark better for everyone.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out to us via the contact form on our website or by submitting an issue on Github.</p>
